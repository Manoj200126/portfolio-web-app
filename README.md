This portfolio is a streamlined, single-page site using HTML5 and CSS (Flexbox/Grid) with Google Fonts. It includes sections for Home, About, Skills, Education, Projects, and Contact. A sticky navbar, smooth scrolling, and a scroll-up button improve navigation, while Typed.js adds a dynamic typing effect. Responsive project cards adapt across devices, and a simple contact form lets visitors reach out.
